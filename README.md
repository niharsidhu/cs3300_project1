In this project, we looked at the top 100 Spotify Tracks of 2017. We used PCA to examine which features in the dataset had the greatest effect on the ranking of the song. Additionally, we examined songs that were outliers in certain features such as energy levels, loudness, valence, and more. The visualizations was created using the D3 JavaScript library.
